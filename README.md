# Project Name
Project 4 2D Platformer Game, October 31st, 2020

This is a 2D Platformer Game created in the Godot gaming software. It is created similar to a mario game, using platformers to collect coins and avoid and dodge enemies. As you increase levels, the challange becomes harder. Each level has a differnt design to it. 

## Implementation
Save and Load (partially) 
Included some coding for the save and load, but was unable to complete the save and load action. (buttons don't work, but when you hit escape it does pause the game)
Game Art for each level
Level Design is different in each level 
Possibly added other features that I was not even aware of..?
